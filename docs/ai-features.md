# Honest News: AI Features

## AI-Powered News Enhancement

Honest News leverages advanced AI models to transform raw news content into a more valuable, contextualized, and personalized experience. This document outlines the specific AI features and their implementation strategies.

## Core AI Features

### 1. Multi-Level Summarization

**Purpose**: Condense articles to different levels of detail based on user preference.

**Implementation**:
- **Brief (30-60 words)**: Extract only the most critical information using 4o-mini
- **Standard (100-150 words)**: Balanced summary using Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- **Comprehensive (250-400 words)**: Detailed summary with nuance using Claude 3.5 Opus

**Prompt Strategy**:
```
You are a highly skilled news summarizer. Summarize the following article in [BRIEF/STANDARD/COMPREHENSIVE] format (approximately [WORD_COUNT] words). 

Focus on:
1. The main event/development
2. Key entities involved
3. Important implications
4. Any notable numbers or statistics

Article:
[ARTICLE_TEXT]
```

**Cost Optimization**:
- Cache summaries to avoid regenerating for multiple users
- Use cheaper models for brief summaries
- Process in batches during off-peak hours when possible

### 2. Scale Contextualization

**Purpose**: Provide accurate context for numbers, investments, impacts to address the scale misrepresentation issue.

**Implementation**:
- Extract numerical data from articles
- Compare to reference database of common scales
- Generate contextual explanations

**Prompt Strategy**:
```
Identify all numerical data points in the following news article that relate to scale (monetary values, energy usage, population impacts, etc.). For each one, provide:

1. The original value mentioned
2. 2-3 meaningful comparisons that help contextualize the scale
3. An assessment of whether this scale is being properly represented in the article

Article:
[ARTICLE_TEXT]
```

**Example Output**:
> The article mentions a "$500 billion investment" in Stargate infrastructure.
> Context: This is:
> - Approximately 2.5x the annual US military budget ($200B)
> - More than the GDP of 75% of the world's countries
> - Equivalent to funding NASA for over 20 years at current levels
> The article underrepresents this scale by mentioning it briefly without these comparisons.

### 3. Fact Verification & Cross-Referencing

**Purpose**: Establish confidence in reported information by comparing across sources.

**Implementation**:
- Extract key claims from articles
- Compare with claims from other sources on same topic
- Assign confidence levels based on consensus
- Highlight discrepancies where they exist

**Prompt Strategy**:
```
Extract the 5-7 most important factual claims from this article. For each claim, identify:
1. The specific assertion being made
2. Any quantitative details
3. Attribution (who is making or supporting this claim)
4. The level of certainty expressed

Article:
[ARTICLE_TEXT]
```

Then, in a separate process, compare claims across sources:

```
I have extracted key claims from multiple articles about [TOPIC]. 
Please analyze the following claims for consistency and contradictions:

Claim 1 from Source A: [CLAIM]
Claim 1 from Source B: [CLAIM]
Claim 1 from Source C: [CLAIM]

Provide:
1. Consensus assessment (High/Medium/Low agreement)
2. Notable contradictions
3. Potential reasons for discrepancies
```

### 4. Topic Clustering & Trend Identification

**Purpose**: Group related stories to show complete picture and identify emerging patterns.

**Implementation**:
- Generate embeddings for articles using local embedding model
- Cluster similar content using algorithms like DBSCAN or K-means
- Identify clusters growing in volume/frequency
- Generate cluster summaries that synthesize multiple sources

**Technical Approach**:
- Use sentence-transformers for embedding generation
- Update clusters incrementally as new content arrives
- Maintain historical cluster data to track evolution of topics

### 5. Interactive Exploration (Premium)

**Purpose**: Allow users to ask follow-up questions about any news item.

**Implementation**:
- Store article content and generated summaries in vector database
- Process user questions in context of specific articles or topics
- Use more powerful models (Claude 4) for complex reasoning

**Prompt Strategy**:
```
You are an AI assistant helping users explore news topics more deeply. The user is asking about an article with the following content:

[ARTICLE_SUMMARY]
[KEY_FACTS]

User question: "[USER_QUESTION]"

Provide a helpful, informative response that:
1. Directly addresses their specific question
2. References information from the article when relevant
3. Distinguishes between facts stated in the article and any inferences or analysis you're adding
4. Maintains a neutral, informative tone
```

## AI Processing Pipeline

### 1. Content Acquisition
- Fetch articles from news APIs
- Clean HTML/formatting
- Extract text, metadata, and images

### 2. Basic Processing (All Content)
- Basic categorization
- Entity extraction
- Brief summarization
- Language detection
- Toxicity/sensitivity screening

### 3. Intermediate Processing (Selected Content)
- Standard summarization

### 4. Advanced Processing (Premium/Important)
- Comprehensive summarization
- Deep analysis
- Historical context generation
- Fact verification across multiple sources

## Prompt Engineering Best Practices

1. **Clear Instructions**: Provide specific, detailed instructions at the beginning of each prompt.
2. **Context Management**: Include only relevant context to minimize token usage.
3. **Output Formatting**: Specify exact output format for consistent parsing.
4. **Few-Shot Examples**: Include examples for complex tasks to guide the model.
5. **Chain-of-Thought**: For complex reasoning, break tasks into sequential steps.
