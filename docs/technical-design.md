## System Components

### 1. Mobile Application (React Native)

#### Core Components:
- **Authentication Module**: Handles user registration, login, and session management
- **News Feed Component**: Displays personalized news articles and summaries
- **Article Reader**: Clean reading experience with text customization
- **User Preferences**: Settings for personalization and display options
- **Premium Features**: Components accessible only to premium subscribers

#### Libraries & Dependencies:
- React Navigation for app navigation
- Redux for state management
- React Native Elements for UI components
- AsyncStorage for local data persistence
- Axios for API requests
- React Native WebView for rendering article content

### 2. Backend Services (Node.js/Express)

#### API Gateway:
- Provides unified interface for all client-server communication
- Handles authentication and authorization
- Routes requests to appropriate microservices

#### Microservices:
- **User Service**: Manages user accounts, preferences, and subscriptions
- **News Aggregation Service**: Fetches, filters, and stores news from various sources
- **AI Processing Service**: Handles communication with LLM APIs
- **Analytics Service**: Collects anonymous usage data for product improvement

#### Libraries & Dependencies:
- Express.js for API framework
- Mongoose for MongoDB ODM
- Redis for caching and session storage
- JWT for authentication
- Node-cron for scheduled tasks
- Winston for logging

### 3. Databases

#### MongoDB:
- User profiles and preferences
- Processed news articles and summaries
- Source credibility metrics
- Long-term storage

#### Redis:
- Session management
- Caching of common requests
- Rate limiting
- Real-time updates

### 4. External API Integrations

#### News APIs:
- NewsAPI (top headlines, everything endpoints)
- The Guardian API
- New York Times API
- Currents API
- Additional regional/specialized news sources

#### AI/LLM APIs:
- OpenAI API (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini)
- Anthropic API (Claude 3.5, Claude 4)
- Local embeddings for content similarity

## Data Flow

### News Aggregation Flow:
1. Scheduled jobs fetch latest articles from multiple news APIs
2. Articles are deduplicated and categorized
3. Basic metadata is extracted (source, publication date, category)
4. Content is stored in MongoDB
5. Notification service alerts users of major breaking news (if enabled)

### News Enhancement Flow:
1. Articles are prioritized for processing based on relevance, importance
2. Batch processing sends content to appropriate LLM APIs
3. AI generates summaries, extracts key facts, identifies scale context
4. Results are stored and associated with original articles
5. Similar stories are clustered to provide full context

### User Experience Flow:
1. User opens app and authenticates
2. App fetches personalized news feed based on preferences
3. User views summaries and can expand to full articles
4. Interactions are tracked anonymously to improve personalization
5. Premium users can access advanced features like follow-up questions

## Optimization Strategies

### Cost Optimization:
- Batch processing of LLM requests to minimize API calls
- Caching of common summaries and analyses
- Tiered processing: basic summarization for all users, advanced analysis for premium
- Smart content deduplication to avoid processing similar content repeatedly

### Performance Optimization:
- Client-side caching for offline reading
- CDN for static assets
- Database indexing for frequent queries
- Pagination of API responses

### Scalability:
- Horizontal scaling of microservices
- Database sharding for growing user base
- Containerization with Docker
- Kubernetes for orchestration (future)

## Security Considerations

- HTTPS for all communication
- OAuth 2.0 for authentication
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Input sanitization to prevent injection attacks
- Regular security audits
- Data encryption at rest and in transit

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: MVP (1-2 months)
- Basic React Native app with authentication
- Integration with 2-3 major news APIs
- Simple AI summarization using cost-effective models
- Core user preferences
- Basic subscription management

### Phase 2: Enhancement (2-3 months)
- Additional news source integrations
- Improved AI processing with fact verification
- Topic clustering and trend analysis
- Advanced personalization options
- Offline reading capabilities

### Phase 3: Premium Features (3-4 months)
- Deep analysis using premium LLMs
- Interactive follow-up questions
- Trend reports and custom digests
- Enhanced UI/UX refinements
- Analytics for product improvement

## Monitoring & Maintenance

- Application monitoring with Sentry
- Performance tracking with New Relic
- Usage analytics with Amplitude
- Automated testing with Jest
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
