# Honest News

## The Problem with News Today

Current news media suffers from several critical issues:

1. **Scale Misrepresentation**: As noted in the comments, journalism often fails to properly convey the scale of events (e.g., the Stargate infrastructure investment receiving disproportionately little coverage relative to its $500B scale).

2. **Disproportionate Coverage**: Topics that generate clicks receive more attention than truly important world events.

3. **Information Overload**: Too many sources, too many articles, not enough time to process everything.

4. **Personalization Gaps**: Existing news platforms rarely adapt to individual interests and knowledge levels.

5. **Fact-checking Challenges**: Readers must independently verify information across multiple sources.
